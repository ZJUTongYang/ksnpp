This repository contains the code for finding non-homotopic shortest paths in a planar environment, which can be also applied to find efficient solutions for tethered shortest paths after the maximum-tether-length constraint is considered. The code is still in continuous improvement. 

Details of the code execution will be explained after the paper is accepted.
